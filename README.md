# John Daniel Semine Portfolio

[Demo](https://johndanielsemine.netlify.app/)

A website-portfolio to show case myself, the technologies I know and what I'm capable of. The website was built with CSS Grids, FlexBox, framer-motion, styled-components and react-intersection-observer.

## Lessons Learned

This was my first time implementing the CSS Grids mixed in with FlexBox. Although I feel confident and knowledgeable in using both, I do think I could have combined them both better.

I also got to use the react-intersection-observer with the useAnimation Hook from the framer-motion library to start animations based on scroll, which was a lot of fun and definitely something I will implement more in the future.

## Potential Future Updates

- At least 2 more projects to show case my skills

- Add customised SVG animations made with Rive or possibly Adobe After Effects
